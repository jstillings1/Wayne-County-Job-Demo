# Wayne County Job Demo
This is a demo site I created for a job interview with local gov back in 2016.
The site is bootstrap and highlights my ability to hard code HTMl, CSS, and
javascript.

I did not get the job, as the local gov was invested heavily in the WordPress
platform and my demo was clearly anything but.
